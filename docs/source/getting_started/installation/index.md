# Installation Method

We provide multiple ways to install and use FABulous.

If you would like to just get started and don't want to care about anything else, go with [venv](#venv-install). If you would like proper python package isolation and prevent dependency problem, go with [uv](#uv-install). After FABulous installation you will also need to install the [CAD tools](#cad-tool-install). If you want an all-in-one package and with absolute encapsulation, go with [docker](#docker-install).

```{toctree}
