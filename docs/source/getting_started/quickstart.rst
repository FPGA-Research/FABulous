Prerequisites
-------------

The following packages need to be installed for generating fabric HDLs. 
If you have encounter problems during installation, please refer to the `Installation` section.

:Python:

Version >= 3.12

:Dependencies:

.. prompt:: bash $

    sudo apt-get install python3-virtualenv

.. note::

    If you get the warning ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'virtualenv'``
    or errors when installing the requirements, you have to install the
    dependencies for your specific python version. For Python 3.12 use

    .. prompt:: bash $

       sudo apt-get install python3.12-virtualenv

.. note::

    If you are using an older version than Ubuntu 24.04, you may need to install tkinter.
    Otherwise, you might get the warning ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'``.

    .. prompt:: bash $

      sudo apt-get install python3-tk

:FABulous repository:

.. prompt:: bash $

    git clone https://github.com/FPGA-Research-Manchester/FABulous

:Virtual environment:

We recommend using python virtual environments for the usage of FABulous.
If you are not sure what this is and why you should use it, please read the
`virtualenv documentation <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.

.. prompt:: bash $

    cd FABulous
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

Now there is a ``(venv)`` at the beginning of your command prompt.
You can deactivate the virtual environment with the ``deactivate`` command.
Please note, that you always have to enable the virtual environment
with ``source venv/bin/activate`` to use FABulous.

The following packages need to be installed for the CAD toolchain:


If you are using yosys oss-cad-suite, no need to install the following packages.

:`Yosys <https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys>`_:
 version > 0.26+0

:`Nextpnr-generic <https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr#nextpnr-generic>`_:
 version > 0.4-28-gac17c36b

:`Yosys ghdl plugin <https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl-yosys-plugin>`_:
 Only needed for VHDL synthesis

We have also provided a command to install the above packages automatically.
.. prompt:: bash $

   FABulous install-oss-cad-suite


.. note::

   We recommend using the `OSS CAD Suite
   <https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build>`_ to
   install the packages.

   If you just want to install Yosys using **apt**, make
   sure you have at least Ubuntu 23.10 (24.04 for the LTS
   versions) installed to meet the above requirement.


Building Fabric and Bitstream
-----------------------------

We offer two ways to run the FABulous flow, either via the FABulous Shell or directly supplying the commands via the command line (similar to Vivado Batch mode).

To use the FABulous Shell, you can run the following command:

.. prompt:: bash (venv)$

  FABulous create-project <name_of_project>

  # to start the shell
  cd <name_of_project>
  FABulous start

  # or

  FABulous --project-dir <name_of_project> start

  # or an special alias for project starting
  FABulous <name_of_project>

If you want to use a specific RTL language (Verilog or VHDL) for your project, you can use the ``--writer`` flag when creating the project.

.. prompt:: bash (venv)$

  FABulous create-project <name_of_project> --writer vhdl
  # or
  FABulous create-project <name_of_project> -w vhdl

Inside the FABulous shell, run:

.. prompt:: text FABulous>

  run_FABulous_fabric
  run_FABulous_bitstream user_design/sequential_16bit_en.v


To run the FABulous flow directly from the command line, you can use the following commands:

.. prompt:: bash (venv)$

  FABulous c <name_of_project> # alias for create-project

  # -p is short for --project-dir
  FABulous -p <name_of_project> run "run_FABulous_fabric; run_FABulous_bitstream user_design/sequential_16bit_en.v"

.. note::

  You will probably receive a warning for the FASM package like the following:
      .. code-block:: text

          RuntimeWarning: Unable to import fast Antlr4 parser implementation.
          ImportError: cannot import name 'antlr_to_tuple' from partially initialized module 'fasm.parser' (most likely due to a circular import)

          Falling back to the much slower pure Python textX based parser
          implementation.

          Getting the faster antlr parser can normally be done by installing the
          required dependencies and then reinstalling the fasm package with:
            pip uninstall
            pip install -v fasm

  This usually happens when FASM can't find the Antlr4 package, but this is not mandatory for us.
  If you still want to fix this issue, you have to install FASM in your virtual environment from source.
  Please have a look at the `FASM documentation <https://github.com/chipsalliance/fasm>`_ for more information.

After a successful call with the command ``run_FABulous_fabric`` the RTL file of each of the tiles can be found in the ``Tile`` folder and the fabric RTL file can be found in the ``Fabric`` folder.

After a successful call with the command ``run_FABulous_bitstream user_design/sequential_16bit_en.v``.
The bitstream and all the log files generated during synthesis and place and route can be found under
the ``user_design`` folder. The bitstream will be named as ``sequential_16bit_en.bin``.
