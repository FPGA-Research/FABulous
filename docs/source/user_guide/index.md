# User Guide

This section contains all the information required for both building your custom eFPGA, and how to use the eFPGA that one have created. To learn how to build your custom fabric, check out the [fabric building documentation](#fabric-building). To learn about how to program the eFPGA, check out the [fabric using documentation](#fabric-using). Whether being a user or designer, everything can be driven by our interactive CLI. For more detail of the capability of the CLI check out the [CLI documentation](#CLI-usage).
