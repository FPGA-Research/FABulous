"""FABulous geometry generator module.

This module provides functionality for generating geometric representations of
FPGA fabrics for visualization and placement tools. It converts fabric definitions
into geometric objects with positioning and routing information.

The geometry generator includes:
- bel_geometry: Geometric representation of Basic Elements (BELs)
- fabric_geometry: Complete fabric geometric layout
- geometry_gen: Main geometry generation controller
- geometry_obj: Base geometric object definitions
- port_geometry: Port positioning and routing geometry
- sm_geometry: Switch matrix geometric representations
- tile_geometry: Individual tile geometric layouts
- wire_geometry: Wire routing and connection geometry

This module is primarily used for:
- Generating CSV files for FABulator visualization
- Creating placement information for CAD tools
- Providing geometric constraints for routing algorithms
- Supporting fabric visualization and debugging
