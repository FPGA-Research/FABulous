## Introduction

FABulous is designed to fulfill the objectives of ease of use, maximum portability to different process nodes, good control for customization, and delivering good area, power, and performance characteristics of the generated FPGA fabrics. The framework provides templates for logic, arithmetic, memory, and I/O blocks that can be easily stitched together, whilst enabling users to add their own fully customized blocks and primitives.

The FABulous ecosystem generates the embedded FPGA fabric for chip fabrication, integrates
[YosysHQ](https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build)
toolchain release packages, deals with the bitstream generation and provides after-fabrication tests. Additionally, we plan to provide an emulation path for system development.

This guide describes everything you need to set up your system to use the FABulous ecosystem, and the full project documentation can be found [here](https://fabulous.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Prerequisites

The following packages need to be installed for generating fabric HDL models and using the FABulous front end:

- Python 3.12 or later

Install python dependencies

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-virtualenv
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you get the warning `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named virtualenv` or
> errors when installing the requirements, you have to install the dependencies
> for your specific python version. For Python 3.12 use
>
> ```bash
> sudo apt-get install python3.12-virtualenv
> ```

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you are using an older version than Ubuntu 24.04, you may need to install tkinter.
> Otherwise, you might get the warning `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'`.
>
> ```bash
> sudo apt-get install make python3-tk
> ```

The following packages need to be installed for the CAD toolchain

- [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys)
- [nextpnr-generic](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr#nextpnr-generic)

### Optional: uv for faster dependency management

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a high-performance Python package manager that provides faster dependency resolution and installation. While not required for end users, it offers significant speed improvements and reproducible environments.

**Benefits of using uv:**

- 10-100x faster than pip for dependency resolution
- Automatic virtual environment management
- Deterministic dependency locking
- Cross-platform compatibility

**Installation:**

Linux/macOS:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

macOS with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install uv
```

Windows:

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Or from PyPI:

```bash
pip install uv
```

## Getting started

We recommend using Python virtual environments for the usage of FABulous.
If you are not sure what this is and why you should use it, please read the [virtualenv documentation](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html).

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/FPGA-Research-Manchester/FABulous
$ cd FABulous
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
(venv)$ pip install -e .
```

You can deactivate the virtual environment with the `deactivate` command.
Please note, that you always have to enable the virtual environment to use FABulous:

```bash
cd <path to FABulous>
source venv/bin/activate
```

We have provided a Python Command Line Interface (CLI) as well as a project structure for easy access of the FABulous toolchain.

The `Tile` folder contains all the definitions of the fabric primitive as well as the fabric matrix configuration. `fabric.csv` is what defining the architecture of the fabric. The FABulous project folder also contains a `.FABulous` folder which contains all the metadata during the generation of the fabric.

We can initiate the FABulous shell with `FABulous <project_dir>`. After that you will see a shell interface which allow for interactive fabric generation. To generate a fabric we first need to run `load_fabric [fabric_CSV]` to load in the fabric definition. Then we can call `run_FABulous_fabric` to generate a fabric.

To generate a model and bitstream for a specific design call `run_FABulous_bitstream npnr <dir_to_top>` which will
generate a bitstream for the provided design in the same folder as the design.

To exit the shell simply type `exit` and this will terminate the shell.

A demo of the whole flow:

```bash
(venv)$ FABulous -c demo # Create a demo project
(venv)$ FABulous demo # Run Fabulous interactive shell for demo project

# In the FABulous shell
FABulous> load_fabric
FABulous> run_FABulous_fabric
FABulous> run_FABulous_bitstream npnr ./user_design/sequential_16bit_en.v
FABulous> exit
```

To run a simulation of a test bitstream on the design with Icarus Verilog:

```bash
(venv)$ cd demo/Test
(venv)$ make sim
```

The tool also supports using TCL script to drive the build process. Assuming you have created a demo project using
`(venv)$ FABulous -c demo`, you can call `(venv)$ FABulous demo -s ./demo/FABulous.tcl` to run the demo flow with the TCL interface.

### Using uv (optional)

If you have [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed (see Prerequisites section), you can use it for faster dependency management and automatic virtual environment handling:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FPGA-Research-Manchester/FABulous
cd FABulous
uv sync                    # Install dependencies and create virtual environment
uv pip install -e .       # Install FABulous in editable mode
```

Running FABulous with uv:

```bash
uv run FABulous -c demo    # Create a demo project
uv run FABulous demo       # Run FABulous interactive shell

# Or activate the environment and run directly:
source .venv/bin/activate
(venv)$ FABulous -c demo
(venv)$ FABulous demo
```

Benefits of using uv:

- No need to manually create/manage virtual environments
- Faster dependency installation
- Automatic dependency resolution and locking
- Consistent environments across different machines
